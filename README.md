# NAME

Clone::Fast - Natively copying Perl data structures

# Deprecation

As of 2013-05-27, this module is no longer maintained or supported and has been removed from CPAN. The code will
continue to be hosted on Github, where anyone can feel free to fork it and update it. Some good alternates which 
should be relatively simple to migrate to are:

* [Storable](http://search.cpan.org/~ams/Storable-2.39/Storable.pm)
* [Clone](http://search.cpan.org/~garu/Clone-0.34/Clone.pm)
* [Clone::PP](http://search.cpan.org/~evo/Clone-PP-1.02/PP.pm)

For any questions or anyone wanting to take on continued maintenance of this code, please email me at
